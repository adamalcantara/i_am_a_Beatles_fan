# I Am A Beatles Fan

## Description

This is a simple project that was the first in my course to learn Flutter and Dart. Much like an app called "I Am Rich" which cost $999.99 on the App Store and served the simple function to tell people you were rich, this app tells people you're a Beatles fan.

The project taught me the basic functionality of Flutter widgets including MaterialApp, Scaffold, AppBar, Center, and Image.
